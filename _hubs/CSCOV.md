CSCOV empowers women by supporting their livelihoods through access to markets, income generation, and education for girls. The organization raises awareness on women’s rights, gender and protection, conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), and gender-based violence (GBV). Through peer-to-peer mentorship, women role models guide younger women and girls from primary to university levels. CSCOV also advocates for stronger implementation of laws protecting women and girls and plans to establish schools in underserved areas to improve educational access.

In our peacebuilding work, CSCOV promotes good governance, transparency, and accountability by empowering communities to be active agents of change. CSCOV strengthens institutional culture for responsible resource management while advancing access to justice and human rights through legal aid and public education. To foster social cohesion, CSCOV facilitates dialogue between political leaders and local communities, ensuring women’s meaningful participation, and organizes inter-communal peace dialogues and trainings that support reconciliation and inclusive, sustainable peace in South Sudan.
