Community Creativity for Development (CC4D) was founded in 2019 in Eden II Zone, Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement, Uganda, by South Sudanese refugees who fled the 2016 conflict in Yei. Faced with the challenges of absence of repair services (high cost and long travel distance to access services), an area neglected by humanitarian aid, the group began offering repair of electronic devices using the basic tools they had fled with. This initiative laid the foundation for CC4D, created to provide community repair services and digital skills training for refugee youth.

In 2023, CC4D’s Executive Director returned to Yei, South Sudan, where youth unemployment was widespread, fueling crime, substance abuse, and violence. CC4D was formally registered as a community-based organization and established a MakerSpace/Repair Café Hub in Yei Town, hosted at the Youth Association Office. This hub offers repair services, e-waste collection and upcycling, digital skills training, and a safe space for young people to rebuild their futures.

CC4D is dedicated to creating awareness and empowering youth, women, and girls in displaced and conflict affected communities through culture of repair, digital literacy, and environmental sustainability. Our work builds social and economic resilience, creates livelihood opportunities, and fosters sustainable development. Our repair cafe approach strengthens social cohesion, advances environmental sustainability, and contributes to lasting socio-economic growth across both refugee and host communities in Uganda and among youth in South Sudan.
