CECI was founded in 2017 by a group of South Sudanese refugees, in response to and for the prevention of conflict among and between refugee and host communities. Through innovative and creative locally led peacebuilding initiatives our aim is to prevent, reduce, and/or transform conflicts. 

CECI emerged to address conflict tensions and ethnic divisions stemming from resource access and utilization, cultural intolerance, hate speech, trauma, and limited employment opportunities among and between refugees and host communities. 

CECI works in collaboration and with support from the local government, Office of the Prime Minister, UNH, CR and other implementing partners.
