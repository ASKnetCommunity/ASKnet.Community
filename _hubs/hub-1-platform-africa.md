Initiated by South Sudanese refugees to empower displaced people in Uganda, they provide (ToT) capacity building workshops for refugee communities to emphasise media skills and promote a peaceful coexistence between refugees and the host community of Arua through peacebuilding, radio and pyschological support programs.

- Community of practice (collaborative network with identified local peacebuilding organizations) capitalizing on documentation, knowledge sharing skills i.e. wikifab, Github, etc (pick up on Adjumani, need for more practice)
- COVID-19 and peacebuilding … how to overcome this challenge strengthen storytelling skills, blogging, photography, podcasting (possibly in collaboration with Ochan’s organization, project on “mobile journalism”) collaborate with other local organizations, pass on new knowledge to them through ChangemakersSkillls)
Training / edit-a-thons on Wikipedia as a medium to create a representation of refugee voices online.
- Broaden an open knowledge base in Rhino Camp through Platform Africa’s #KendaTogether library project and exploring the creation of content for mobile offline servers to increase access to digital resources.
- Create educational videos on purposeful and crucial topics of misinformation, stereotypes, and hate speech to act as tools for training for local initiatives and beyond.
- Mobile information center on COVID19 and other community issues using the lab mobile (During the pandemic period).
- Support + connect platform Africa tribes with/through training and mentorship. So far, we have people sign up to three tribes namely, entrepreneurship, peacebuilding (to be integrated with the community of practice), and open tech and innovation.
