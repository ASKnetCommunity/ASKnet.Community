### FOUNDATION

Co-founders of GoGirls ICT Eva Yayi and Yine Yenki became aware while lecturing at the college of Computer Science and IT at the University of Juba that female students weren’t performing well. They were shy, didn’t participate in class, they didn’t show interest on technology. Eva and Yine were conscious the root problem was the perception of gender in South Sudan and a culture that doesn’t encourage girls and women to learn technology and ICT. They started out advising female students at the university and organizing weekend workshops with enrolled and incoming students to exchange experiences and teach technology and life skills.

Eva observed that “most organizations in South Sudan haven’t explored ICT and hacktivism for women. We felt this was a topic that could gain a lot of momentum. Also because of the conflict and people talking about feminism around the world, we thought this could be a great chance for girls, women and communities to discuss about women in technology. This is how we came with the idea of GoGirls ICT.” For Yine, “founding GoGirls ICT was a calling from God.
