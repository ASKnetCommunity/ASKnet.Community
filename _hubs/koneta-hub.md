KONETA was founded to address the urgent challenges of poor health, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, unsafe water, and limited access to education affecting grassroots communities across South Sudan. Dedicated to supporting vulnerable groups (especially women, youth, and children), KONETA works to ensure efficient, effective, and sustainable service delivery that fosters healthier, more resilient communities. The organization engages across key sectors including health, education, food security, protection, and WASH, with a strong understanding of both local contexts and operational needs.
