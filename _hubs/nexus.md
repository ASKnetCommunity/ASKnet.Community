Nexus Youth Initiative (NYIU) operates in the communities of Adjumani, Moyo, and Obongi, and in the refugee settlements, addressing local challenges faced by vulnerable youth and women to promote sustainable community development.

We do this through:

- Training programs for youth, focused on open technologies and media skills.
- Media for advocacy, fostering peaceful coexistence and spiritual growth among refugee and host community youth.
- Socio-economic empowerment initiatives that build sustainable, resilient, and self-reliant communities.
- Peacebuilding actions using media and sports to inspire spiritual, social, and economic transformation.
- Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) for youth through integrated social and behavior change communication (SBCC) and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention strategies, combining community-based and digital awareness approaches.
