Initiated by South Sudanese refugees to empower displaced people in Uganda, Platform Africa delivers Training of Trainers (ToT) workshops to build media literacy skills within refugee communities. Our goal is to foster peaceful coexistence between refugees and host communities in Arua through peacebuilding initiatives, radio programs, and psychosocial support.

As a Community of Practice (CoP), Platform Africa collaborates with local peacebuilding organizations, promotes strong documentation practices, and shares open knowledge through platforms such as Wikifab and GitHub. We focus on peacebuilding through storytelling, blogging, photography, and podcasting, giving communities a platform to share their experiences and voices for positive change.
