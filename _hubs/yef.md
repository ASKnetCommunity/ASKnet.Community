Youth Empowerment Foundation (YEF) works with the community of Adjumani and displaced people in the Pagirinya Refugee Settlement to address local challenges such as unemployment and gender-based violence. 

YEF was founded in the Pagirinya refugee settlement in Uganda in 2017 to support the trauma-prone and vulnerable refugee communities. YEF has since grown into a team of design thinkers, information technicians, and storytellers who collaborate to engage and empower their communities through media, education, and technology.

We aim to build equitable, informed, and resilient refugee societies by providing tools, training opportunities, and access to knowledge and resources that help overcome illiteracy and reduce poverty.
