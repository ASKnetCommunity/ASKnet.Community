YEF works together with the community of Adjumani and displaced people in the Pagirinya refugee settlement to addresses local issues of unemployment and gender-based violence. We aim to do this through trainings for youth that focus on open technologies and media skills, entrepreneurship, peacebuilding, and attitude change.


YEF was founded in the Pagirinya refugee settlement in Uganda in 2017 in order to support the trauma-prone and vulnerable refugee communities. YEF has since grown and today includes design-thinkers, information technicians, and storytellers who work together to engage and empower their communities through the power of media, education, and technology. We want to build more equitable, informed, resilient refugees societies and work to give them the tools, training opportunities, and access to  knowledge and resources needed to battle illiteracy and mitigate poverty.
