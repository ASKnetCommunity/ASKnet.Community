## #ASKotec - Origin & Idea

The #ASKotec (Access to Skills and Knowledge Open Tech Emergency Case) was created to bring hands-on technical learning to places with limited resources. Developed by the #ASKnet community, the kit provides everything needed to teach repair, innovation, and open technology skills, from soldering and solar power to electronics and upcycling. Housed in a rugged, dust-proof case, each kit contains over 50 essential tools, components, and open-source guides. Designed for mobility, collaboration, and reuse, #ASKotec turns scarcity into opportunity, empowering communities to learn, build, and share knowledge anywhere.

  url="https://askotec.openculture.agency/" 
  text='The #ASKotec Media Kit was born from the #ASKnet network’s need to make media education accessible anywhere, especially without stable power or internet. A modular learning and storytelling toolkit packed with exercises for community media training. The kit combines portable, low-tech tools with open learning guides, helping communities document their stories, share local knowledge, and amplify youth and women’s voices in media for peace, inclusion, and resilience.
