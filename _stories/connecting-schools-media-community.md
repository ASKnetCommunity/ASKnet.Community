# Connecting Schools, Media Makers, and Community Creativity

At the heart of the settlements, the **Creative Innovation Center (CIC)** is quietly shaping the next generation of media-savvy changemakers. Through its close integration with the community, CIC fosters learning beyond the classroom, linking school clubs and grassroots media teams to practical skills, creative expression, and local storytelling.

## School Clubs: Learning in Action

CIC works directly with **secondary school clubs**, providing guidance, mentorship, and resources to help students explore ICT, media production, and civic engagement. These school clubs aren’t just extracurricular activities—they are hubs where young people build confidence, experiment with ideas, and bring their communities’ stories to life. By connecting students with CIC mentors, these clubs become a living bridge between education and community participation.

## Media Makers: Learning on the Job

In parallel, CIC supports an independent **Media Makers team**, a small but dedicated group of learners who have taken the initiative to form their own media collective. Starting as recently as April, this team is already producing content, learning hands-on, and extending CIC’s reach into local storytelling. Their curiosity and commitment demonstrate how creative opportunities can flourish even outside formal programs.

## Embedded and Resilient

What sets CIC apart is its **resilient structure and deep community roots**. The organization is led by a highly skilled individual with post-secondary education, providing strong management and strategic guidance. CIC’s embedded position within the settlements allows it to leverage partnerships, respond to local needs, and extend its training beyond its immediate programs—showing that sustainable creative capacity-building comes from relationships as much as from curriculum.

Through initiatives like **school clubs and media makers**, CIC exemplifies how community-centered innovation can empower young people, nurture emerging talents, and strengthen local storytelling ecosystems—paving the way for future generations of informed, capable, and engaged citizens.
