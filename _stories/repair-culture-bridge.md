# Repair Culture as a Bridge for Peace and Innovation

In the heart of Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement, a quiet revolution hums beneath the surface — the whirr of a soldering iron, the click of recycled circuit boards, the laughter of young technicians tinkering with purpose. **Community Creativity for Development (CC4D)** turns everyday repair into a catalyst for social cohesion, innovation, and environmental care.

Formed in 2019 by a group of South Sudanese refugee youth tech professionals, Dawa Edina, Richard Maliamungu and Mathew Lubari, CC4D has grown into a dynamic, cross-border initiative with hubs in **Rhino Camp, Uganda**, and more recently in **Yei, South Sudan** - where the co-founders originally come from. Their mission is simple yet transformative: to **connect communities through creativity, technology, and repair**. Whether fixing a broken radio or co-designing an open-source IoT project, CC4D uses practical innovation as a bridge between people — across divides of displacement, nationality, and experience.

> “Repairing together is more than fixing things — it’s how we rebuild trust, share knowledge, and remind each other that sustainability starts with care.”  <br><br>
> *— Mathew, CC4D Co-Founder*

## The Right to Repair — and to Belong

CC4D’s co-founder, **Mathew Lubari**, has become a recognized advocate for the *right to repair* movement across East Africa — championing repair culture not only as an environmental imperative but also as a **social practice of resilience**. Through **Repair Café events**, youth from refugee and host communities come together to learn electronics repair, refurbish devices, and reduce e-waste while fostering dialogue and connection.

These gatherings have become symbolic spaces of peacebuilding — demonstrating how shared skills and purpose can counter isolation, dependency, and division. For CC4D, repair isn’t just technical work; it’s a vehicle for **preaching social change**, a way of turning small acts of maintenance into acts of collective care.

## Technology for Local Solutions

Beyond repair cafés, CC4D’s projects demonstrate how open-source innovation can thrive even in low-resource settings:

* **💧 Auto Water Dispenser (2023)**  
   In response to public health crises like COVID-19 and Ebola, CC4D engineers designed a **low-cost, Arduino-powered automatic handwashing device** for schools. Using recycled plastic containers and rechargeable batteries, the dispenser reduces contamination risk while modelling circular design and community recycling.

* **🌱 IoT Soil Moisture Monitoring Device (2024)**  
   Developed for refugee settlement gardens, this device uses **Arduino sensors** to monitor soil conditions and optimize irrigation, helping farmers prevent crop loss and manage limited water supplies. Built with open-source tools and community training, it illustrates CC4D’s blend of digital literacy, environmental stewardship, and local problem-solving.

These projects, shared openly through the [CC4D GitHub repository](https://cc4d.tech/projects/), enable others to replicate and adapt their models — turning knowledge into an ecosystem of mutual aid and digital inclusion.

## A Growing Network of Makers

As part of the **#ASKnet (Access to Skills and Knowledge Network)**, CC4D stands within a larger movement of grassroots innovation hubs across East Africa. They are also members of **GIG (Global Innovation Gathering)**, **AfricaOSH**, **Africa Makerspace Network**, and **GOSH (Global Open Science Hardware)** — connecting local ingenuity to a global dialogue on open technology and sustainability.

> “We use what we have, to make what we need — together.”  <br><br>
> *— CC4D Team Motto*

In 2021, CC4D received international recognition, winning the **EU: Africa “Journey Hackathon” award** for Job Security and Financial Services, affirming their model of creative resilience as a viable pathway toward youth empowerment and sustainable livelihoods.
