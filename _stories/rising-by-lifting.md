# We Rise by Lifting Others

The Center for Strengthening Community Voices (CSCOV) is a women-led civil society organization dedicated to amplifying the voices of communities, especially women and girls, in local, national, and regional decision-making spaces.

CSCOV believes that when civic dialogue flourishes, accountability and democratic freedoms follow. Through advocacy, mentorship, and economic empowerment initiatives, the organization is helping communities shape their own futures.

> “We rise by lifting others. Civil society action is essential for good governance when it empowers communities and makes them catalysts for their own change.”<br><br>

### Women’s Economic Empowerment  

CSCOV focuses on empowering Women to make their living through livelihood activities that support access to markets for their products, earning money to help women send their girls to schools. CSCOV advocates for stronger laws to address economic injustice and enable girls’ education.

### Education & Protection of the Girl Child  

Through Peer-to-peer counseling and mentorship programs with women who are role models for young women and girls from primary, secondary schools and universities.

We engage in advocacy on the effective implementations of Laws and policies that protect women and Girl Child. CSCOV promotes girls’ education and plans to establish schools in underserved regions, with limited access to education.
