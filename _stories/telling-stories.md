# Telling Stories that Heal, Connect, and Inspire Change

In the heart of Kiryandongo district, Uganda, the **Kiryandongo Video Advocates (KVA)** are proving that storytelling can be one of the most powerful tools for peace, empowerment, and local integration.

A **refugee- and host-community-led organisation**, KVA emerged from the need to bridge divides and amplify the voices too often left unheard. Founded by young changemakers in the Kiryandongo refugee settlement, KVA trains and mentors youth in **video advocacy** — the art of using film to document social realities, raise awareness, and influence policy and community dialogue.

## What Is Video Advocacy?

Video advocacy goes beyond filmmaking — it’s storytelling with purpose. For KVA, each short film, documentary, or screening event is an opportunity to spotlight local realities, mobilize community support, and inspire collective problem-solving. Their approach blends **media production, civic education, and psychosocial support**, helping communities process trauma while reimagining a shared future.

Working across **refugee and host communities**, KVA facilitates open discussions following film screenings, using these safe spaces to address social tensions and promote inclusion. These dialogues, often held in settlement meeting halls or under a tree in the village square, have become a cornerstone for **local integration and peacebuilding** between South Sudanese refugees, Sudanese arrivals, and Ugandan hosts.

Each story becomes a living archive — a visual testimony of perseverance that strengthens both individual agency and collective understanding.

## Dialogue, Healing, and Integration

The impact of these films extends beyond the screen. After screenings, KVA hosts facilitated discussions where community members unpack the stories they’ve just seen — reflecting on shared struggles and exploring practical solutions. This participatory process helps reframe narratives of displacement and conflict into narratives of **shared humanity and hope**.

In collaboration with the **#ASKnet network**, KVA integrates these media-based activities into broader digital literacy and advocacy training programs. Their work complements **repair cafés**, **women’s empowerment sessions**, and **peacebuilding dialogues**, offering a multimedia bridge between technical skills and social cohesion.

## Looking Ahead

KVA’s vision extends beyond Kiryandongo. With growing expertise in **digital storytelling, advocacy, and entrepreneurship training**, they aim to establish a network of **youth media hubs** across Uganda’s settlements, providing sustainable career pathways and strengthening local resilience through creative expression.

Their work is a reminder that **advocacy doesn’t always start in policy rooms — sometimes it begins behind a camera, in the hands of a young storyteller who believes their community’s voice deserves to be heard.**
